	The ad.html has a very specific format.

	Really there are two "ads" contained within this file.

	The first ad displays to participants who are browsing
	the Amazon Mechanical Turk site but have not yet accepted
	your hit.

	The second part of the ad display after the person selected
	"Accept HIT" on the Amazon website.  This will reload the
	ad and will display a button which, when clicked, will pop
	open a new browser window pointed at your local psiTurk
	server (assuming it is running and accessible to the Internet).

	See comments throughout for hints

							    <p>
									The Visual Intelligence Lab at UCLA is looking for online participants
									for a brief for a brief experiment on decision making.
							    </p>

							     <p>The experiment will take roughly 15 minutes to complete. </p>

							     <p>The requirements for participation are:</p>

							     <ul>
							        <li>You are at least 18 years old,</li>
							        <li>You have normal vision or wear corrective lenses, and</li>
							        <li>You are a fluent English speaker.</li>
							    </ul>

							    <p>Note: the experiment will only work in recent browsers, and
							     may have difficulty loading on slower connections.</p>

							    <div class="alert alert-danger">
									<strong>This task can only be completed once.</strong>
									If you have already completed this task before the system will not
									allow you to run again. If this looks familiar please return the
									HIT so someone else can participate.
							    </div>
							    <p>
								    Otherwise, please click the "Accept HIT" button on the Amazon site
								    above to begin the task.
								</p>


							{% else %}

								<!--
									OTHERWISE
									If assignmentid is NOT "ASSIGNMENT_ID_NOT_AVAILABLE"
									it means the participant has accepted your hit.
									You should thus show them instructions to begin the
									experiment ... usually a button to launch a new browser
									window pointed at your server.

									It is important you do not change the code for the
									openwindow() function below if you want you experiment
									to work.
								-->
							    <h1>Thank you for accepting this HIT!</h1>
							    <p>
							    	By clicking the following URL link, you will be taken to the experiment,
							        including complete instructions and an informed consent agreement.
